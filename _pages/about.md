I am an economist from Universidad de los Andes with a minor in History and Chinese Language and Culture. Currently, I am a candidate for a Master's degree in Economics at the same university. Additionally, I serve as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the master's econometrics course and as the lead instructor for a data analysis course using R, both at the University of los Andes. My research focuses on creating counterfactual images using convolutional neural networks to address issues related to the Violation of SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) in causal inference.

I work in two broad areas of knowledge. Firstly, in Causal Inference, where I engage in applied econometrics to evaluate the impact of policies or treatments. Secondly, in the field of Machine Learning where I develop predictive and generative models. 

In Causal Inference, I employ various methodologies such as Differences in Differences, Regression Discontinuity Design, Synthetic Control, and RCTs to analyze questions pertaining to Political Economy and applied microeconomics. Furthermore, I utilize Machine Learning tecniques to tackle challenges across the financial, public, and energy sectors. Specifically, I specialize in developing machine learning models aimed at establishing default scores for Fintech, predicting anomalies in user reports within the public sector, and detecting significant events such as energy losses and service interruptions within the electric sector. Additionally, I have contributed to the analysis of fatal accident data for the District Mobility Secretariat, aiding in the construction of predictive and reinforcement learning models for ambulance dispatch.
