I hold a B.A. and an M.A. in Economics from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, with minors in History and Chinese Language and Culture. I am currently working as a consultant at the World Bank Group in the Development Economics Research Group (DECRG). My research focuses on applied and theoretical econometrics, particularly in the context of Development Economics. This includes work in Political Economy, International Trade, and Public Economics.

My current research centers on Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), with a particular focus on spillover effects, treatment heterogeneity, optimal treatment allocation, and the integration of machine learning into these methodologies.

Previously, I served as an Adjunct Professor and Teaching Assistant for various courses at Universidad de los Andes. I have also conducted research in both the private sector (Quantil) and the public sector (Colombian Central Bank and DIAN).
